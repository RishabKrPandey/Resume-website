## 📖 About The Project

I built this portfolio from scratch to move away from generic corporate templates. I wanted a digital space that reflects my approach to data science: **grounded, thoughtful, and organic.**

The design follows a **"Botanical Minimalist"** theme, utilizing earth tones (Sage, Clay, Off-White) and organic shapes to create a calm, professional reading experience.

### Key Features
* **🌱 Botanical Theme:** Custom CSS variables for a consistent Earth-tone palette.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Custom Mobile Menu (Hamburger) layout for smaller screens.
* **✨ Scroll Animations:** `IntersectionObserver` API used for "Scroll Reveal" fade-in effects.
* **⚡ Lightweight:** Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript with no heavy frameworks.
* **🔍 SEO Optimized:** Includes Open Graph tags for rich social media previews.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid), Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Icons:** CSS-based shapes and Emoji integration.
* **Fonts:** 'Cormorant Garamond' (Serif) & 'Montserrat' (Sans-Serif) via Google Fonts.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
